# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis:
An analysis was performed to determine the number of retiring employees per company title.  An additional analyis was requested to identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. 

## Results of the Analysis:

* That reduced our working list from 133,776 to 90,398.
* Out of those 90,398 employees that are set to retire, we saw the following break down per title:
   * Senior Engineer: 29,414
   * Senior Staff: 28,254
   * Engineer: 14,222
   * Staff: 12,243
   * Technique Leader: 4,502
   * Assistant Engineer: 1,761
   * Manager: 2
* Finally, a total of 1,549 employees were identified as eligible for the mentorship program.
